Granular insight into resource usage : Orchestration tools give greater insight into how many resources are being used by what software, services, or customers." />
      <item value="A monitoring tool detects an increased load on the service An orchestration tool responds to this by spinning up additional resources to handle the load. When the load decreases again, the tool spins the additional resources back down, freeing them up to be used by something else. All of this happens while the engineer is getting coffee" />

Insight : With good configuration management, you can know about the state of all pieces of a large and complex infrastructure.

      <item value="Faster time-to-market : Get features into the hands of customers more quickly rather than waiting for a lengthy deployment process that doesn’t happen often. Fewer problems caused by the deployment process : Since the deployment process is frequently used, any problems with the process are more easily discovered. Lower risk : The more changes are deployed at once, the higher the risk. Frequent deployments of only a few changes are less risky. Reliable rollbacks : Robust automation means rollbacks are a reliable way to ensure stability for customers, and rollbacks don’t hurt developers because they can roll forward with a fix as soon as they have one. Fearless deployments : Robust automation plus the ability to rollback quickly means deployments are commonplace, everyday events rather than big, scary events." />
      <item value="Each version of the code goes through a series of stages such as automated build, automated testing, and manual acceptance testing. The result of this process is an artifact or package that is able to be deployed. When the decision is made to deploy, the deployment is automated. If a deployment causes a problem, it is quickly and reliably rolled back using an automated process(hopefully before a customer even notices the problem!). Rollbacks aren’t a big deal because the developers can redeploy a fixed version as soon as they have one available. No one grips their desk in fear during a deployment, even if the deployment does cause a problem." />
      <item value="◇ Usually, build automation looks like running a command-line tool that builds code using configuration files andor scripts that are treated as part of the source code. ◇ Build automation is independent of an IDE. ◇ Even if you can build within the IDE, it should be able to work the same way outside of the IDE. ◇ As much as possible, build automation should be agnostic of the configuration of the machine that it is built on. ◇ Your code should be able to build on someone else’s machine the same way it builds on yours." />
      <item value="Continuous integration is usually done with the help of a CI server. When a developer commits a code change, the CI server sees the change and automatically, performs a build, also executing automated tests. This occurs multiple times a day. If there is any problem with the build, the CI server immediately and automatically notifies the developers. If anyone commits code that “breaks the build” they are responsible for fixing the problem or rolling back their changes immediately so that other developers can continue working." />
      <item value="Early detection of bugs : If code doesn’t compile or an automated test fails, the developers are notified and can fix it immediately. The sooner these bugs are detected, the easier they are to fix! Eliminate the scramble to integrate just before a big release : The code is constantly merged, so there is no need to do a big merge at the end. Makes frequent releases possible : Code is always in a state that can be deployed to production. Makes continuous testing possible : Since the code can always be run, QA testers can get their hands on it all throughout the development process, not just at the end. Encourages good coding practices : Frequent commits encourages simple, modular code." />
      <item value="Fast : Automation handles tasks that would otherwise need to be done manually. Consistent : The build happens the same way every time, removing problems and confusion that can happen with manual builds. Repeatable : The build can be done multiple times with the same result. Any version of the source code can always be transformed into deployable code in a consistent way. Portable : The build can be done the same way on any machine. Anyone on the team can build on their machine, as well as on a shared build server. Building code doesn’t depend on specific people or machines. Reliable : There will be fewer problems caused by bad builds." />

      <item value="A Cargo. This is the central class in the domain model, and it is the root of the Cargo-Itinerary-Leg-Delivery-RouteSpecification aggregate. A cargo is identified by a unique tracking id, and it always has an origin and a route specification. The life cycle of a cargo begins with the booking procedure, when the tracking id is assigned. During a (short) period of time, between booking and initial routing, the cargo has no itinerary. The booking clerk requests a list of possible routes, matching the route specification, and assigns the cargo to one route. The route to which a cargo is assigned is described by an itinerary. A cargo can be re-routed during transport, on demand of the customer, in which case a new route is specified for the cargo and a new route is requested. The old itinerary, being a value object, is discarded and a new one is attached. It may also happen that a cargo is accidentally misrouted, which should notify the proper personnel and also trigger a re-routing procedure. When a cargo is handled, the status of the delivery changes. Everything about the delivery of the cargo is contained in the Delivery value object, which is replaced whenever a cargo is handled by an asynchronous event triggered by the registration of the handling event. The delivery can also be affected by routing changes, i.e. when the route specification changes, or the cargo is assigned to a new route. In that case, the delivery update is performed synchronously within the cargo aggregate. The life cycle of a cargo ends when the cargo is claimed by the customer. The cargo aggregate, and the entire domain model, is built to solve the problem of booking and tracking cargo. All important business rules for determining whether or not a cargo is misdirected, what the current status of the cargo is (on board carrier, in port etc), are captured in this aggregate." />

Credentials used to authenticate Kiali to those external services can be defined in the &quot;auth.password&quot; and &quot;auth.token&quot; values within the &quot;auth&quot; sub-section. Because these are sensitive values, you may not want to declare the actual credentials here in the Kiali CR. In this case, you may store the actual password or token string in a Kubernetes secret.

At the moment, the value of the icon annotation can only be one of &quot;rest&quot;, &quot;grpc&quot; or &quot;graphql&quot;; otherwise, it is ignored. By default, these settings recognize API Documentation links via annotation &quot;kiali.ioapi-spec&quot; and icon-annotation &quot;kiali.ioapi-type&quot;. For example, it would make Kiali recognize these annotations in a service or a workload definition (Deployment, StatefulSet, etc.) to display the appropriate link and text: annotations: kiali.ioapi-spec: http:linktomydoc kiali.ioapi-type: rest Should you change this setting for your own custom annotations, keep in mind that it would override the current default.
